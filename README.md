# StandardizeBows
Standardize Bows is a Unity ( C# ) project that is created in order to setup bow models that will simulate the physics of a bow without having any animation or animator component being attached to the bow. It is something that I currently use in my hobby project. I hope by sharing it more people can benefit from it.

Advantage of using C# for this case is the customizability aspect. 

Also it might help to people who don't have any experience in animation :)

## Pros

⇛ If you are not experienced in a modelling software and you don't have the time and energy to learn them like I don't, this asset is for you ! 

⇛ If you are creating a game that has lots and lots of bow models, this asset is for you ! 

⇛ If you want your player stats to affect and interact with the movement of the bows like in a RPG game, this asset is for you ! 

## Cons

⇝ However, because of the way this C# script achieves this process, this script is not viable for a game that has more than 100 of these bows concurrently active in a scene ( Like a RTS game would have ). 

★★★★★ Where this script really shines is the customizability aspect of it.★★★★★

# ❂ FEATURES ❂ 

► Realistic looking simulation of a bow being drawn and fired off. 

► Three different types of script sets for your bows and projectiles. First one is the standalone version that doesn't require a bow user. Other two versions are developed in order to integrate the simulation of the bow with Humaoid character's animations. One with the animator states and the other ones use animator boolean parameters. 

► Modular state like coding in order to allow users to easily add/remove functionality. 

► Projectile and particle object pooling. 

► Collision detection with different types of surfaces and on hit particles and sound effects. 

► Clear documentation and the scripts are heavily commented and organized.
