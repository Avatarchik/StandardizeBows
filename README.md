# StandardizeBows
Standardize Bows is a Unity ( C# ) project that is created in order to setup bow models that will simulate the physics of a bow without having any animation. Advantage of using C# for this case is the customizability aspect. 

Also it might help to people who don't have any experience in animation :)
